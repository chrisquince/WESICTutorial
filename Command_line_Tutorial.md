## Basics of bioinformatic : Introduction to command lines
Most workflows in bioinformatics are built with command lines in a terminal. The way to interact with files is different from graphical interface, you can't click on anything and need to type a command for the slightest operation, even changing directory. However, terminal is much more versatile than graphical interface : you dispose of various tools to explore your files, do simple text manipulation or just write simple scripts to automatize a task.   
 

### Navigation using command lines
A command is a script/program/application .... installed on your device. To use them, you need to type their name followed by argument and options. Example : 

    Command -option argument
All command presented below are always present on bash terminals.

 ### Connection to server
During this tutorial we will all work each on a server connected through the internet. The first step is to open a terminal, in which we will type commands.
On your mac, click on launchpad (the rocket), other and terminal.
We use the ssh command to connect. 

    ssh user_id@ip_adress
Today our user id is going to be the same : ubuntu
You will all get a different ip address, one for each server. Choose one. 
 

    ssh ubuntu@137.205.69.3   # server A
    ssh ubuntu@137.205.69.58  # server B
    ssh ubuntu@137.205.69.73  # server C
    ssh ubuntu@137.205.69.65  # server D

**Get information about a function** : *man*

**List all files and folders** : *ls*

Try to use **man**  on **ls** A lot of different options are available. Try for yourself  the following : 
 - ls -l
 - ls -lh
 - ls -a
 - ls -alh

Which one are folders, which one are files? 

**Change directory** : *cd*

Try to go into  Dummy :

    cd Dummy
Go to directory Data :

    cd Data
You should now see a path on your terminal :

*ubuntu@wesic-tutorial:~/Data*

This indicate where you are : 

 - **~** is your home folder
 - **Data** is the current folder you are in

You can go back to the directory containing Data by using  :

    cd   ../

You can use a path instead of a directory :

    cd Data/Soil
You can go back more than once 

    cd ../../

You can also go back to your home folder by typing just cd 
 
 ### Simple files exploration 
 **Look into a file**  

    cd  Data/Soil
How big are the files in this folder ? What would happen if you were to try and open then in a text editor?
Look into them by using 
 - less 
 - more 
 - head
 - tail
 
Type q to  quit.

**Number of line in a file** 
*wc -l file*

    wc -l  Bulk_Soil_Sub.fastq

 A fastq entry contain 4 lines for each read. How many reads are there?  
 
**Search for a pattern**   
*grep pattern file*
**grep** will return any line of the file containing the pattern. 
Lets try to see if we can find some absurds reads :

    grep AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Rhizosphere_Sub.fastq

Which reads are they? Lets use the option -B 1 to show the line just before the pattern.

    grep -B 1 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Rhizosphere_Sub.fastq

### Combination of commands
You can combine commands by sending the output of a command line as input to a second one using the symbol pipe **|**.
Lets try to count the number of stop codon in a Fastq file. 

    grep TAG Rhizosphere_Sub.fastq | wc -l


### Text edition 

**Writing**  
*Command line > file*

Using the symbol **>** will allow to write the output of previous command into a file. 

     grep TAG Rhizosphere_Sub.fastq > Codons_TAG.txt 

**Text editors** 

A few text editors are available on the terminal, 

 - vim
 - emacs
 - nano

Legend states that after spending a few months learning how to use them , vim and emacs are fantastics text editors!
For everyone else, nano exist.

    nano Codons_TAG.txt



**Remove file**  
*rm file*

    rm Codons_TAG.txt

### Writing a simple script 
The terminal allow you to write scripts. You can for instance loop through files and  apply the same treatment. 
Let's write a simple script which will loop through all folders of Data, and count the number of erroneous reads. It is going to take time executing, so feel free to interrupt it at any time using key combination ctrl + c

    cd 
    cd Data
    for file in */*/*
    do 
    	echo $file
    	echo $file >> Number_of_AAA_in_all_Data_files.txt
    	grep AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA $file | wc -l >> Number_of_AAA_in_all_Data_files.txt 
    done

 - **\*** is called a wild-card : it can replace anything, here it is used to select everything inside all folders insides all folders. 
 - **file** is variable, to access the value of the variable you need to add **$**
 - **echo** is a command used to print a variable, so it is responsible for printing the value of **file** on screen, and in Number_of_AAA_in_all_Data_files.txt.
 - We use **>>** instead of **>**, it allows to append at the end of a file, while **>**  would recreate a file each time
